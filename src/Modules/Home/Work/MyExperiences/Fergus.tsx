              Fergus is the brainchild of Dan Pollard, a veteran Tradie. He
              dreamed it up a few years ago, while he was knee deep in the
              trenches of running his own trades business. Dan figured out that
              a trades business needs proper systems in place to keep it running
              without running its owner into the ground.
            </p>

            <p>
              Fergus is the operational backbone of trades businesses, taking
              care of the day-to-day and providing complete clarity and control.
              It gives business owners and managers the time and insight they
              need for the business to grow and succeed.

              Over time the Fergus mobile app has aged visually and its
              framework has become dated, making it difficult for new developers
              to work on and with less ecosystem support.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              And so... the development of Fergus Go began, a new multi platform
              mobile app built with the react native framework.

              As a Software Engineer within the Fergus Go team, made up of
              designers, product managers, QA's and other software engineers,
              I've formed a great relationship with them and we've delivered
              some awesome features and improvements to the platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been responsible for leading feature developments - breaking
              down tasks, creating concise tickets for the team, facilitating
              discussions on feature architecture, developing solutions,
              reviewing code and coordinating with the team to mitigate
              blockers.
