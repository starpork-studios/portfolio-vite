            Smartsims provides universities all around the world with
            educational business simulation software. They have a range of
            simulations but their most popular is MikesBikes. A simulation where
            students control their own bike manufacturing company which they use
            to compete in a multiplayer environment against their peers. Their
            goal, to achieve the highest market shareholder value they can.

              These simulations were built a over 10 years ago so naturally the

              While the majority of core foundations are just as relevant today
              as they were back then, the user experience was in need of some
              modernisation.

              I worked as a Software Engineer at Smartsims in a small team
              focused on the continuous improvement of core functionality as
              well designing and developing a new modernised product.
